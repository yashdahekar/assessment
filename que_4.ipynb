    "2. EDA:\n",
    "perform an EDA to understand the structure and quality of the dataset. this includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "data sets and their types (numeric, categorical) search features.\n",
    "ensure that missing values ​​are handled properly (e.g. imputation).\n",
    "visualization of distributions and correlations using plots (histograms, scatter plots, etc.).\n",
    "identify outliers and decide how to deal with them.\n",
    "3. key technologies:\n",
    "feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing features to improve model performance. common methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "handling of classification changes (encoding, single hot encoding).\n",
    "scaling to the same numeric factors (min-max scaling, standardization).\n",
    "developing new products based on domain knowledge or product interactions.\n",
    "4. model selection:\n",
    "select the appropriate machine learning model for the regression task. for the Bangalore building dataset, we can use support vector machine (svm) regression due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data.\n",

    "5. model training:\n",
    "divide the dataset into training and testing sets. then, use the training data to train the svm regressor. during training, the model learns the relationship between inputs (e.g. field t.).\n",
